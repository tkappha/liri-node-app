Before You Begin

*  Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
*  To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these      Node packages crucial for your assignment.  You'll use Request to grab data from the OMDB API.
