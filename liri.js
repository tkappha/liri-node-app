//code to grab data from keys.js; store keys in a variable

//liri.js should be able to take in one of following commands:
//my-tweets - shows last 20 tweets and when they were created in Bash window

//spotify-this-song '<song name here>'  shows artist(s), song's name, preview 
//link of the song from Spotify, album that song is from.  If no song is provided,
//then program defaults to "The Sign" by Ace of Base

//movie-this '<movie name here>' output movie title, year, imdb rating, country
//movie was produced, language of movie, plot, actors, rotten tomatoes url.  If
// user doesn't type a move in, outputs data for 'Mr Nobody'  
// use API key: 40e9cece

//do-what-it-says.  using fs Node package, LIRI takes the text inside of random.txt
// and uses it to call one of LIRIs commands.  It should run spotify-this-song 
// for "I Want it That Way".  feel free to change the text in the random.txt doc 
// to test out the features for other commands

// ****************************
//              BONUS
//******************************
// in addition to loggin data to your bash window, output data to a 
// .txt file called log.txt  - make sure you append each command you run
// to log.txt, do not overwrite your file each time you run a command
